# Why Python

Python is an interpreted language with simple syntax. It has many prebuilt libraries to simplify Machine Learning model building process

Since Python is an interpreted language it doesn't required compilation or jar file creation like other programming languages

#Python Basics

## Arithmetic Operations

Python supports all basic arithmetic operations like addition,subtraction, multiplication, division , exponetial, modulus operations etc
